# Hybridization-of-Steganography-and-Cryptography

Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within other
seemingly innocent media to ensure its confidentiality. This paper explores the
combination of steganography with encryption algorithms to provide enhanced
security and privacy for covert communication. By integrating encryption
algorithms with steganographic techniques, the hidden data becomes doubly
protected, making it challenging for unauthorized parties to access or decipher the
concealed information.
 The proposed approach addresses the need for robust security in secret
communication. It provides an additional layer of protection by leveraging
encryption algorithms alongside steganography. This combination not only
conceals the existence of the secret message but also ensures that even if the
hidden information is detected, it remains unintelligible without the proper
decryption key.
 The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid
approach. The combination of steganography and encryption algorithms provides
a secure and inconspicuous communication channel for transmitting sensitive
information. The integration of encryption ensures the confidentiality of the hidden
message, while steganography disguises its presence, making it resistant to
detection by adversaries.
